# K-Means-An-Unsupervised-learning-algorithms
K-Means Clustering is an Unsupervised Learning algorithm, which is used to group the unlabeled  dataset to different clusters/subsets. In this algorithm ‘k’ states the amount of pre-defined clusters  that need to be shaped in the procedure of clustering say if k=2, there will be two clusters, for k=3,  there will be three clusters, and so on. The terms clustering goals at forming subsets/groups within a dataset comprising of data points which are similar to each other and the clusters/subsets formed can be knowingly distinguished from each other.
